# Sherweb.Apis.Distributor

[Version française](LISEZMOI.md)

## Summary

This is the nuget source code of the Distributor API.<br><br> As a Sherweb partner, you are considered a distributor when you buy products and services directly from a supplier, Sherweb for instance. Therefore, as a distributor, you need to know what you owe Sherweb for a specific billing period. To do that, you can use the Distributor API. <br><br> More precisely, you get the list of charges for a specific billing period and all the information you need for each charge in order to process them in your own management system.
