## NuGet packages source code

We have an organization on nuget.org: https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Sherweb. All public NuGet packages are there. This repository provides all the source codes for these NuGet packages if you want to build them on your own instead of using built packages. Each folder is an API and there is a Readme for each. To build the code, you will need to open the .sln file in Visual Studio.

## Sample code

In the folder SampleCode, you will find all the examples on how to use the NuGet packages. All examples are in C#. This is where you will need the clientId, clientSecret and subscriptionKey. Feel free to submit any code enhancements to us.

## Documentation

You can find all the documentation related to these APIs here: https://developers.sherweb.com/.
