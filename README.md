# Sherweb public APIs

[Version française](LISEZMOI.md)

## Prerequisite for using the APIs

You need to have added an application with API keys within the Sherweb partner portal: https://cumulus.sherweb.com. On the left menu, under Security, click on the APIs menu:

Add a new application. Make sure to copy the *Client Id*, *Client Secret* and *Subscription Key* which are required in order to use the APIs:

## NuGet packages source code

We have an organization on nuget.org: https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Sherweb. All public NuGet packages are there. This repository provides all the source codes for these NuGet packages if you want to build them on your own instead of using built packages. Each folder under **NugetPackagesSourceCode** is an API and there is a Readme for each.

## Sample code

In the folder **SampleCode**, you will find all the examples on how to use the NuGet packages. All examples are in C#. This is where you will need the *Client Id*, *Client Secret* and *Subscription Key*. Feel free to submit any code enhancements to us.

## Postman
In the folder **Postman**, you will find all files allowing you to test the APIs directly with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). There is a "Collection" for each API plus an "Environement". Here's a quick how-to-use :
1. Set your *ClientId*, *ClientSecret* and *SubscriptionKey* in the environment.
2. Use the Authorization collection to retrieve your token.
3. Set this token in the "Authorization" section of each API call (replace YOUR_TOKEN by your token).
4. Voilà.

## Documentation
