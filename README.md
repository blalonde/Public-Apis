## Nugets source code

We have an organization on nuget.org: https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Sherweb. All public nugets are there. This repository provides all the source codes for these nugets if you want to build it on your own instead of using the nuget. Each folder is an API and there is a Readme for each. To build the code, you will need to open the .sln file in Visual Studio.

## Sample code

In the folder Sherweb.SampleCode, you will find all the examples on how to use the nugets. All examples are in c#. This is where you will need the clientId, client secret and subscription key. Feel free to submit any code enhancements to us.

## Documentation

You can find all the documentation related to these APIs here: https://developers.sherweb.com/.
